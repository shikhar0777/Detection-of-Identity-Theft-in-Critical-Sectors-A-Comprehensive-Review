This paper was published on 12th Annual Conf. on Computational Science & Computational Intelligence (CSCI'25) Las Vegas 3rd dec to 5th dec // Springer Nature Paper




PurThe paper reviews existing methods for detecting identity theft across sectors like finance, government, and healthcare focusing on critical sector

Methods: Analyzed peer-reviewed studies, comparing traditional machine learning methods, deep learning, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Evaluated their performance in accuracy, sensitivity, precision and other matrix.

Key Findings:

Graph Neural Networks performed best overall for real-time and accurate detection.

Support Vector Machines and Random Forests had high precision, reducing false alarms.

Deep learning models detect complex patterns but can be slower and resource-intensive.

Most research focuses on large organizations, leaving gaps in protecting individuals and small-scale attacks.

Contribution: The paper identifies research gaps and recommends adaptive, sector-specific detection methods that include protection for everyday users, not just big institutions.

Takeaway: Effective identity theft detection requires intelligent, context-aware models that can detect suspicious behavior across time and connections, with GNNs being a promising approach.
