Overview.

This paper reviews identity theft detection techniques used in critical sectors such as finance, government, and healthcare. It analyzes how different machine learning approaches perform in detecting fraudulent and malicious identity-related activities.

Methods

Peer-reviewed studies were analyzed and compared across:

Traditional machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest)

Deep learning methods

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and related performance metrics.

Key Findings

Graph Neural Networks perform best for accurate and real-time detection.

SVM and Random Forest models achieve high precision with fewer false alarms.

Deep learning models capture complex patterns but are often slower and resource-intensive.

Most research focuses on large organizations, with limited attention to individual users and small-scale attacks.

Contribution

The paper identifies research gaps and recommends adaptive, sector-specific identity theft detection methods that also protect everyday users.

Takeaway

Effective identity theft detection requires context-aware models that analyze behavior over time and relationships between entities. GNNs are a promising approach for future systems.
